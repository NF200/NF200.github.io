<h2>Myself</h2>

I have 4 younger <br> siblings and we are all BASICALLY 3 years apart from the last. I have two dogs back home, <br> Rocky and Scooby, a chihuahua mix and german shepherd. Some of my hobbies include playing <br> the violin and learning how to do new things... like skateboarding.</p>
