<h2>Myself</h2>
<p>As you may know... or not. I am Nathaly Flores and studying to become a software engineer.<br> I was born in Santa Ana, California but lived most of my life in Atlanta, Georgia. I have 4 younger <br> siblings and we are all BASICALLY 3 years apart from the last. I have two dogs back home, <br> Rocky and Scooby, a chihuahua mix and german shepherd. Some of my hobbies include playing <br> the violin and learning how to do new things... like skateboarding.</p>
